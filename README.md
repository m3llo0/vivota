# Vivota Education (Business Website)
Vivota Education is the very first website I created for a real-world business. It is the digital touch point for a professional tuition centre, that helps students and parents explore the courses offered, get information about the tutors, and contact the tuition centre easily. This project is a front-end implementation of the website, built with modern web technologies such as NextJS and Tailwind CSS.
