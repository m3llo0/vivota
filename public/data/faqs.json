    "question": "How is Vivota different from normal tuition?",
    "answer": "Most centres just overload you with notes and homework. At Vivota, every student enters the Vivota Learning System: Vivota Mentors check in with students, a two-session cycle (Concept Class → Team Session), and a simple actionable 14-day plan. We diagnose your gaps, teach only what matters for exams, and keep tuning the plan until your marks move."

  {
    "question": "What if the student is unable to make it for the lesson due to last minute commitments?",
    "answer": "There are 2 sessions a week per subject. They can come for the other session. If that is also not feasible, fret not — all our sessions are recorded so students who are absent can replay the lesson in the comfort of their own home."
